# raspi-kiosk

Quickly set up a Raspberry Pi to boot directly into a fullscreen browser.

## Instructions:

```
git clone git@github.com:amorphitec/raspi-kiosk.git
cd raspi-kiosk
./raspi-kiosk
```

## Notes:

* Derived from work done on [OpenGB](https://github.com/amorphitec/opengb) to boot directly into an interface for controlling 3D Printers.
* Tested on Raspi + Raspbian but may work on other platforms. If not raise an issue or better yet a PR!
